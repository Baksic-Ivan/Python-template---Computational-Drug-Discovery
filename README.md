# Python sample - Computational Drug Discovery
This project serves as a Python code sample and it contains computational drug discovery that could help to initate the discovery of novel drugs.  
For my project I have selected EGFR inhibitor drugs because approximately half of cases of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) overexpress EGFR.  
I created Random Forest regression model that predicts inhibitor pIC50 value based upon its molecular descriptors. This model could be used to predict the pIC50 value of novel drugs based on their molecular descriptors.  

#### This project is seperated in five parts:
**Part One** consists of downloading and filtering bioactivity data for EGFR inhibitors from ChEMBL database.  
**Part Two** contains exploratory data analysis using Lepinski descriptors.  
In **Part Three** I have calculated molecular descriptors.  
**Part Four** consists of Random Forest regression model building and performance report.  
In **Part Five** I compared Random Forest regression to other regression algorithms.
